            <p class="font">Julia Evans is an extremely influential person in the software and operations engineering community. Her blog and Twitter account are super-popular, but the one thing you should know about Evans is that she has an always-learning mindset. While this post isn't saying that you need 10 years before you can become a programmer, it is saying that you should always feel as if you're "becoming" a programmer—even after you've gotten your first job. And while the years when she could devote more time to programming were the most beneficial, the years of less frequent hobby work in grade school and college helped build an important foundation. The bulk of this goes over the most interesting programming milestones in her life.
                You can also go back through Evans' blog archives and read over 30 daily reports on her time at Hacker School (now called the Recurse Center). This post's title was inspired by Peter Norvig's famous post, Teach Yourself to Program in Ten Years, which you should also read.
